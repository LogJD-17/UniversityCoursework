Project Proposal: An Analysis of Heart Disease 

10+6+6+8+2+3+5+12 = 52

This is an interesting project with a clear objective. There are several issues however

that require further clarification: 1) the background for the project is incomplete;

2) although data pre-processing has been done, data modifications are not suggested;

3) ethical considerations have not been mentioned; 4) the data analysis methodology

is not clear.
