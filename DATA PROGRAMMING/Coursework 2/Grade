The main research objective is to analyse the factors and indicators

that contribute to the diagnosis of heart disease is clear, but should

be explained more precisely in computational/technical terms.

Error handling scenarios have not been mentioned.

The data have been preprocessed by selecting 14 out of 76 attributes

(but without explanation) and removing features with high p-values.

The code is simple and well structured.

The code is well structured, and it is clear that it has been developed iteratively.

The results have been only briefly analysed using the R-squared measure,

and visualization is not provided.

The coursework implemented a simple linear regression algorithm to

study how much variance can be explained by the independant variables.

Advanced techniques for data analysis were not considered for this task.

The novelty seems to be in performing p-value analyses and application

of linear regression to analyse data from patients with heart diseases.

The presented coursework is original, as it not only uses Python

fundamentals studied during the lectures and workshops,

but also presents students research with modern libraries.
